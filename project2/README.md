## High Level Approach
We started with the provided sample code as the backbone for our project. We roughly followed the steps laid out in the project description. The first step was to route the incoming packets to the update, forward data, and dump functions accordingly. Using print statements to test the correctness of our functions along the way, we make sure the routes table is updated correctly after each UPDATE message. When we receive a DATA FORWARD message, the routes table is scanned and all routes whose first n digits (where n is the number of consecutive 1's starting the netmask) match the destination are selected and the first one found receives the forwarded packet. We do not have any tie-breaking logic yet but we understand the structure of how it will integrate with our program. There were no significant challenges to the milestone portion of this project beyond a minor issue with the development environment and needing to use Vim.
